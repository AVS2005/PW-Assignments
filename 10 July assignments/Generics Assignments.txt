What is the input and output stream in java?
Ans:-Generics in Java are used to provide type safety and reduce code redundancy by allowing the use of 
generic types. It allows classes, methods, and interfaces to be written generically, without specifying the type of 
data being used.

2.What are the benefits of using Generics in Java?

ANS:-The benefits of using Generics in Java are:

Type safety

Code reusability

Improved readability

Reduced code redundancy

Improved performance

3. What is a Generic Class in Java?

Ans:-A Generic Class in Java is a class that can work with different types of data. It is defined using a type 
parameter enclosed in angle brackets, which represents the type of data being used.

4.  What is a Type Parameter in Java Generics?

parameter enclosed in angle brackets, which represents the type of data being used.


6. What is the difference between ArrayList and ArrayList<T>?

 ArrayList is a non-generic class, while ArrayList<T> is a generic class. ArrayList<T> provides type safety, as it 
can only store elements of the specified type, whereas ArrayList can store any type of element
