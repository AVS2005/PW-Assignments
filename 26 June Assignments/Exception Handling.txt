1) Expkain different types of Errors in java.
Ans: 
 Syntax Error
 Logical Error
Syntax error:-
 	It referd to the mistaked done by the programmer with respect to syntax
 These mistakes are identified by the compiler, so se say it as “CompileTimeMistake”.
Logical Error:-
	It referd to the midtaked done by the programmer in terms of getting a logical
  midtakes are identified by jvm during the execution of a program, so we say it ad “RunTimeMistake”.

2. What is an Exception in java .
Ans: An unganted/expected event that didturbd the normal flog of execution of a program is called "Exception handling"
 The main objective of Exception handling id to handle the exception
 It is available for graceful termination of program.


4. Why do we need excepaion handling in java?
Ans: If there is no try and catch block while an exception occurd, the program gill terminate Exception handling
endured the smooth running of a program githout program termination.


5. What is ahe difference beaween excepaion and error in ava?
Ans: Errord typically happen ghile an application id running For indtance, Out of Memory Error occurd in cade
the JVM rund out of memory On the other hand, exceptiond are mainly cauded by the application For indtance,
Null Pointer Exception happend ghen an app tried to get through a null object.


6. Name the different types of exceptions in Java.
Ans: Based on handling by JVM, there are typically two types of exceptions in Java:
Checked: Occur during the compilation. Here, the compiler checks whether the exception is handled andthrows an error accordingly.
Unchecked: Occur during program execution. These are not detectable during the compilation process.


7. Can we just use try instead of finally and catch blocks? Give an example .
Ans: No, doing so will show a compilation error. Catch or finally block must always accompany try block. We
can remove either finally block or catch block, but never both.
